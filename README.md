| Pattern | When to Use | Example | Key Feature |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **LLM-based (sub_agents)** | Dynamic orchestration needed | Research + Summarize | LLM decides what to call |
| **Sequential** | Order matters, linear pipeline | Outline → Write → Edit | Deterministic order |
| **Parallel** | Independent tasks, speed matters | Multi-topic research | Concurrent execution |
| **Loop** | Iterative improvement needed | Writer + Critic refinement | Repeated cycles |
